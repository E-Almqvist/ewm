# Epsilon Window Manager 

## About
This is a tiling window manager for Xorg based of the suckless' [dynamic window manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/). In short, **ewm** *is a fork of* **dwm**.

## Why?
It is a fork. I maintain it, improve it, and make it actually useable rather than saying that everything is "bloat". If you don't like it: then don't use it.

## Future plans
 - A better configuration system (actual config file)
 - A nice bar
