## CHECK OUT THE STABLE BRANCH FOR A STABLE VERSION
The `stable` branch is always stable and will not screw stuff up. Consider the `master` branch a "bleeding edge" branch and will probably segfault after 2 seconds.

#### THIS IS A FORK!
This is my version of dwm with applied patches. Feel free to use it but I recommend creating your own version. You can find dwm at https://dwm.suckless.org/.

## Installation
 1. `git clone https://github.com/E-Almqvist/dwm.git`
 2. `cd dwm/src && make install`
 3. [Check out the XSession installation](xsession/)
